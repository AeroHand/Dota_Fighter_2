How to make a map:
Make a normal dota map, and throw down 2 "info_target" entities, one named "left_edge" and the other "right_edge". Done! Combat will take place between these two targets.
For now, keep the points along the x-axis (or close to it). Eventually, I'll do some maths to rotate the camera yaw, but getting a playable game is higher priority right now.
The X-axis is the red arrow when moving entities in the map editor.

Image Source:
I didn't make it, and I'm still looking for the original author. If you own it, CONTACT ME (check your email), I just want a thumbs up and image that isn't squished...

Derivative Work:
Have at it! Feel free to update, modify, and redistribute as you wish.
I'd prefer you let me be the only "DotA Fighter 2", but I'm cool with something like "Super DotA Fighter 2". If you don't agree, it's whatever, you probably have your reasons.
Don't worry about keeping my name or giving credit, just make this a better game mode than it currently is. Attribution appreciated, not required.
